              Zinnia is an 8 year old Bernese Mountain Dog, and she is pretty much the sweetest dog on the planet. She is a bit of an old lady now, and her favorite hobbies include sleeping, and watching the world go by from her little spot on top of our field (and ofc eating). When we got her, she was smaller than both of our cats, however, she quickly grew and now weighs about 120lbs!

              LALU!
              <img src="/media/testcat.jpeg" alt="aecs" class="d-block" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:45%">
              Lalu is one of our two cats (and the substantially larger one!) She is 13 years old, and we got her from a farm where we found her and her brother Joe (shown below) when I was 4 years old. My brother named Lalu, and she has always been a fan of sleeping on my bed with me at night, until we moved houses, and my room is now too hard for her to access.

              MOWGLI!
              <img src="/media/aecs.jpg" alt="aecs" class="d-block" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:45%">
              Mowgli is my horse, and he is a 14 year old Irish Sport Horse/Thoroughbred. He has a very unique personality, where he is quite grumpy 90% of the time, but the other 10% he is actually a very sweet horse. Mowgli loves to jump, and is best friends with his really old pasture-mate, Ploof. I've had Mowgli for 3.5 years or so now, which is the shortest amount of time we've had any of our pets.

              <img src="/media/lalucover.jpg" alt="Lalu" class="d-block" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:45%">
              Joe is my other cat, he is Lalu's brother, and is also 13 and from the same place as her. He is the chillest cat on the planet and is really sweet. When was younger he got hit by a car running across the street, but recovered quickly, and it's impossible to tell that had ever happened now. He enjoys being outside and will occasionally spend nights outdoors, and is overall a very adventurous cat.
