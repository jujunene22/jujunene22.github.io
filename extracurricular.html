              I started nordic skiing in 8th grade, and started racing more seriously as a freshman. (I got dead-last in the one race I did in 8th grade which was just really sad, but oh well, at least there was nowhere to go but up)

              RIDING
              <img src="/media/aecs.jpg" alt="aecs" class="d-block" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:45%">
              I've been riding since almost before I can remember, I always did it with my friends and we had a really good time together. As mentioned in my brief paragraph about myself, last year I was able to go to Nationals, which was really exciting, and it was a really good experience (although the 15 hour drive was not fun). My horse's name is Mowgli, and while he can be quite sweet on occasion, he is often very grumpy, and not to thrilled about people.
